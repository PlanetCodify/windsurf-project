Used Windsurf To create a game as a user using very minimal prompts. The idea is to evaluate the capability of the AI, which is really good. I have not witnessed the same quality results while using bolt, v0 or lovable interfaces yet. This is good! 

I want to understand how close we are to create apps or websites for a user who has no knowledge of code. This will change everything!

# Car Race Game

## Introduction
This is a car race game built using JavaScript and HTML. Over time, the game has evolved with improved visuals and gameplay. The goal of the game is to avoid obstacles, score points, and survive for as long as possible. The game progressively gets faster as your score increases.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game by opening the appropriate URL for the version you want to play.
2. **Control Your Car**:
   * Use the **LEFT ARROW** and **RIGHT ARROW** keys to move the car left and right.
   * Avoid obstacles (cars, potholes, barricades) and try to survive as long as possible while scoring points.
3. **Watch the Speed**: The game will progressively get faster as your score increases, making it more challenging to avoid obstacles.
